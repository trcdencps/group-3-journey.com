            <span class="square"></span>
            <p>Streaming is a way for people to communicate with one another. Ever since the pandemic happened, face to face conversation stopped, through the use of the internet we could continue to catch up with one another. Streaming is used not only to communicate to one another, but also entertain others or to give them information. In our journey in streaming, we choose first our topic and our content type for our stream. We used the Design Thinking Process to brainstorm and perform Basic Research to the different platforms for streaming. This could help us be more familiar and know more about streaming.</p>

            <p>During our EG 3-4 we did a survey for 30 students and as they responded we have seen that 50% of the respondents vote for Interviews, 30% of the respondents vote for QandA Sessions and 20% of the respondents vote for Tutorials. We have seen that the majority of respondents wants Interviews to be our content type but we didn’t choose it. Instead we choose QandA Sessions because the viewers can also engage in questions and share their opinions and ideas in the stream so we think QandA Sessions are good for our topic.</p>

            <p>
                <br>➢ To increase their reading comprehension<br>➢ knowing what different experiences each student has when reading and if it helps them cope during the pandemic.<br>➢ For viewers to know the different types of benefits that you can get from reading.<br>➢ Students have to be able to quickly understand the topic.<br>➢ It makes students smarter.

            <h1>A Short Overview<br>of our Quarter 1 Journey</h1>
            <span class="square"></span>
            <p>Starting the Quarter 1 is quite exciting as a new journey being a Grade 10 student continues. We all met as one group which is Group 3 in Lifelabs and other subjects so we started it with so much anticipation and excitement. In Lifelabs, we did a short quiz about the fitting of different roles in a group during EG 1 and continuing the EG we did Basic Research at EG 2 about the different streaming platforms. During EG 3-4, we conducted a survey for our chosen content type and the opinions of each respondents. In EG 5-6 we determine the needs of the viewers, such as our chosen content type Q&A Sessions and chosen streaming platform Facebook. Now we are on EG 7, the last EG and the ending of Quarter 1, we are now creating a website documenting our journey and learnings throughout the whole quarter. A new challenge awaits us at Quarter 2 and we hope we could be able to surpass them together as a team and group.</p>
